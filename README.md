# xGad Rating System
An Elo inspired football rating system aiming to quantify team's relative attacking and defensive strengths. This project was conducted as my final disseration for the Applied Social Data Science MSc course at the University of Exeter.
The ratings are inherently lagged, therefore the rating in a given game is assigned from the team's last performance. Dependent on the quality of performance, controlled by xG, the relative rating will go up or down. Therefore, these ratings can be used as pre-game predictors, which may be of particular interest for the betting industry. There are improvements needed for this model, but initial indications are positive.
I would recommend looking at the flowchart or the dissertation prior to looking at the code.
